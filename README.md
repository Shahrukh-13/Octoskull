# Octoskull
This is my animatronic OctoSkull project. It is inspired by papercraft designer Methakura's OctoSkull papercraft.

When I saw her papercraft I immediately thought that it will look so awesome if the tentacels could move, so I made this project. The skull is made of paper and its design is taken from Methakura's free OctoSkull papercraft. The tentacles use different servos and the frame is built mostly with MG996/MG995 compatible servo brackets (I had to use some acrylic pieces for the microservos).

# Arduino
I am using Arduino Mega 2560 to control 12 Servos, WS2812 RGB LEDs, 3 Relays. 

The Reason I choose Arduino Mega 2560 is because I have both servos and WS2812 RGB LEDs in this project and if you use Arduino's servo library and FastLED library togeather in the same program you will see some problems. The problem happens because of the interrupts, Arduino's servo library uses interrupts and FastLED disables innterupts when it is writting to the LEDs. You can read more about the issue here: https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-and-servos/overview

The easy solution is to use Arduino Mega 2560 as it has 4 16-bit Timers, this allows us to control total 12 servos on pins 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 44, 45, 46. Adafruit has an alternate servo library called Adafruit_TiCoServo which makes it very easy to control servos on these pins.

There are 2 arduino sketches in the Octoskull//Arduino/ folder. Following is the brief description of each sketch:

1. **Octoskull-Animation.ino:** has the servo animation arrays that are generated by Blender, they are saved in the flash memeory of the microcontroller. The saved animation runs in a loop.
2. **Octoskull-Animation_live.ino:** reads serial data coming from blender to control the servo motors. This lets you do live animation from blender. You can use this sketch to create the animation, export the data and copy it in the Octoskull-Animation.ino sketch to run in a loop.

## Arduino Libraries
I have the library files added in the Octoskull/Arduino/Library/ folder. I am also adding the Github links for the libraries here:

1. Adafruit_TiCoServo: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TiCoServo
2. FastLED: https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

# Papercraft
The skull is made of paper. The design of the skull is from Methakura's free OctoSkull papercraft. This is the link of the designer's website: https://methakura.gumroad.com/

and this is the link of the OctoSkull papercraft where I took the skull from: https://methakura.gumroad.com/l/octoskull?layout=profile

I have added the PDF file of the paercraft in the /Papercraft/ folder. There are two versions of skull in this papercraft, if you want to make the one I made then use Page 1-8. The papercraft does not have the cutouts on the sides and the top of the skull, you will have to cut them out yourself and put WS2812 LED Rings inside.
