My animatronic OctoSkull Project files

This animatronic OctoSkull project is inspired by papercraft designer Methakura's OctoSkull papercraft.

When I saw her papercraft I immediately thought that it will look so awesome if the tentacels could move. So I made this project. The skull is made of paper and its design is taken from Methakura's free OctoSkull papercraft. The tentacles use different servos and the frame is built mostly with MG996/MG995 servo brackets (I had to use some acrylic pieces for the microservos).

# Papercraft
This papercraft skull is a part of free papercraft designed by Methakura. This is the link of the designer's website: https://methakura.gumroad.com/

and this is the link of the papercraft where I took the skull from: https://methakura.gumroad.com/l/octoskull?layout=profile

I have added the PDF file of the paercraft in the /Papercraft/ folder. There are two versions of skull in this papercraft, if you want to make the one I made then use Page 1-8. The papercraft does not have the cutouts on the sides and the top of the skull, you will have to cut them out yourself.
